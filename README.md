## Design

### Design Choices
The webpage was designed to be easy to navigate and eye catching with a nice contrast of colors to appeal to the customer, it was made to be fully responsive on all devices. 

### Colour
I wanted to use bright colours for the design, to attract the customer to the website. the colour chosen for the main background and the majority of the websote was #DB2929.
White #ffffff was then used for the text accorss all part of the website and also black #111111 where a white background was used. #50C878 was used mostly in the quiz game of the website, to give positive feedback on correct answers. 
<br>

![Colour scheme](docs/features/color-scheme.jpg)


### Fonts
Righteous, which is a google font was used for all text elements of the website.
![Font Family](docs/features/font-family.jpg)

### Logo

The logo was made from the font-family Righteous and the words 'Love Sports!' was concanated

### JavaScript Validation
The JSHint code quality test, showed a few unused variables, this is because they were in external folders, or being used by cdn's, after a lot of googling it looks like it should be put in the top of each file as a global variable comment. this is evident in a few of the js hint screenshots and folders, once this was done all JS folders pass.

 * Player profile images: are fetched from the API-Sports Football API
 * Team crest images: are fetched from the API-Sports Football API


### Code
* Bootstrap was used in many areas of the website to make it responsive.
* Jquery was used to add some animation and was also used to develop the API for both the 'Premier league standings' & 'Top Goal Scorer's Table' using the getJSON method.
* The function used was seen on a youtube video. the video showed a function to loop through certain data, I then used this technique to loop through the endpoints I wanted to suit my requirements
* the template literal code at the bottom of each API, I saw this technique on another youtube video to append the data onto the DOM
* The quiz game was based on a quiz game I made on a online tutorial in the past (before my code institute course), I used this concept, and added more functions into the quiz game to make it more interactive. 
* The timer function I made from looking at documentation on w3 schools and some stack overflow forums.

## Future Addtions
In the future I would like to add more leagues to the football stats table, and add easy, medium and hard versions of the quiz. 
I would also like to add the function to store the users score.
